Tidy Tuesday Implementation using Python
This repository is a python implementation of the very famous Tidy Tuesday repository which contains a lot of datasets and aims at helping people get access to data to perform data analysis and visualizations.

Motivation
The motivation behind this repository comes from data screencasts done by David Robinson. In these videos, David looks at the data set and starts analyzing it live without previously seeing it. The Tidy Tuesday repo is built for the R ecosystem. But I wanted to practice my skills and wanted to implement these in Python using Pandas (for handling data) and Plotnine (for data visualization).

Plotnine is a visualization libary in Python based on the very famous R package ggplot.
